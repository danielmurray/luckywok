Lucky Wok (幸福閣): Heat Mapped Google Place Queries
===========

- Dan Murray (唐慕儒)

Lucky Wok was the name of the Chinese restaurant near my house when I was growing up. I always liked chinese food and I'll be moving out of my house soon to a new city, who knows where. I want my next apartment to be walking distance from a Lucky Wok, or some other random combination of two Chineesy words, e.g. Golden, Dragon, Emperor, Jade or Panda. So I made this.
